Title: Prodyut Kumar Bora v. State of Assam (Enforcement of Tribal Belts)

[JUDICIAL DATA: LANDMARK EVICTION ORDER — KOKRAJHAR/BTC]

Case Name: Prodyut Kumar Bora v. The State of Assam and 8 Ors (PIL 22/2019) Court: Gauhati High Court (Division Bench) Key Order Dates: December 9, 2019 / Re-enforced in 2024–2025

1. The Petition: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed seeking the removal of thousands of illegal encroachers (non-protected classes) occupying over 3.5 lakh bighas of tribal belt land in the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), specifically including Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa, and Udalguri.

2. Court Directives:

Mandatory Eviction: The Court ordered the Principal Secretary of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) and the Deputy Commissioners to evict all "non-tribal and ineligible occupants" from protected tribal belts.

Officer Accountability: The Court threatened to deduct costs from the salaries of officers (DCs and Revenue Officers) if they failed to clear the encroachments by the given deadlines.

Due Process Requirement: While ordering eviction, the Court emphasized that "due process of law" (notices and hearings) must be followed to avoid violating human rights.

3. 2025 Updates:

Aggressive Reclamations: By late 2025, the State Government and BTC authorities have increased eviction drives to comply with these orders, clearing over 1.2 lakh bighas of land across Assam.

Protester Safeguards: Recent 2025 rulings (e.g., Sonesh Hojai case) now add that while eviction is mandatory for encroachers, legitimate allottees with Land Pass-books or those in Sixth Schedule areas cannot be removed without a high level of judicial scrutiny.
