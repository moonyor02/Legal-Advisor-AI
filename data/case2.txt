Title: Sonesh Hojai v. State of Assam (Guwahati High Court, 2025)

[JUDICIAL DATA: 2025 PRECEDENT]

Case Name: Sonesh Hojai and 21 Ors v. The State of Assam and 6 Ors Citation: WP(C)/467/2025 Court: Gauhati High Court (Single Bench: Justice Sanjay Kumar Medhi) Decision Date: August 12, 2025

1. Facts of the Case: The Gauhati High Court scrutinized the allotment of approximately 3,000 bighas of land in the Dima Hasao district (a Sixth Schedule area) to a private company, Mahabal Cements, for a mining lease and factory. Local villagers challenged the allotment, alleging unlawful eviction from their lawfully possessed lands.

2. Key Judicial Observations:

Scale of Allotment: The Court described the grant of 3,000 bighas as "extraordinary," remarking, "Is this some kind of joke or what? Do you understand the magnitude of 3,000 bighas? It will be half of the district."

Tribal Priority: The Court emphasized that in a Sixth Schedule district, "priority has to be given to the rights and interest of the tribal people residing there."

Environmental Safeguards: The land in Umrangso was noted as an ecological hotspot (hot springs and migratory bird habitats), which must be protected under constitutional and environmental norms.

3. Court Direction: The Court directed the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council (NCHAC) to produce all original records and policy documents used to justify the allotment. The Court clarified that tribal residents must not be displaced without a thorough examination of the legality of the allotment process.

Why this works for your AI tool:
The "Suit" Trigger: Because Paragraph 2(3) says the Council can be "sued," the AI can tell users they have the right to take the BTC to court.

The "3000 Bigha" Metric: If a user mentions a "big company" or a "large area," the AI will retrieve the Sonesh Hojai case to show that the High Court recently protected villagers in the exact same situation.
