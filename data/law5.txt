Title: Chapter X — Protection of Tribal Belts and Blocks (Assam Regulation 1886)

[KLLA DATASET: STATUTORY LAW — PROTECTIVE MEASURES]

1. THE RESTRICTION (Section 160-162):

Prohibition: No person shall acquire any right to land in a notified tribal belt or block by transfer, exchange, lease, mortgage, or gift unless they belong to a "protected class."

Void Transfers: Any transfer of land in these areas to an "ineligible person" (non-tribal/non-protected) without prior DC permission is legally invalid (void).

2. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

Land is reserved for notified "Protected Classes" (e.g., Bodos, Rabhas, Koch-Rajbongshis, Scheduled Castes, Santhals, and Tea-tribes).

In the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) region (Kokrajhar, etc.), these protections are enforced strictly to prevent land alienation.

3. EVICTION AUTHORITY (Section 165):

Unauthorized Occupation: Any person identified as an "ineligible" occupant is liable for summary eviction.

Notice Requirement: While summary eviction is permitted, "due process" as established by the 1886 Regulation mandates a formal notice period (usually 15 days) before physical removal.

4. BAR ON CIVIL COURTS:

Civil courts are generally barred from interfering with orders passed by Revenue Officers regarding tribal belt protections.
