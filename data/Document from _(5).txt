Case Study & 2025 Judicial Guidelines
Case Reference: Sadou Asom Goria Jatiya Parishad vs. State of Assam (Gauhati HC, Oct 2025).

The 2025 "Fair Eviction" Guidelines: In October 2025, the Gauhati High Court issued strict instructions for all eviction drives under this Act (and the Land & Revenue Regulation):

Mandatory 15-Day Notice: Authorities must serve a prior notice at least 15 days before initiating any physical eviction drive.

Anti-Discrimination: Evictions must be conducted without discrimination based on caste, religion, or language.

Indigenous Protection: While the government has the right to clear encroachments, the process must be transparent, and native residents are generally shielded from summary displacement without rehabilitation consideration.

Application in Kokrajhar: This Act is the primary tool used by the BTC for clearing Market Areas and PGR/VGR (Village Grazing Reserves). For example, recent 2025 survey actions in Kokrajhar town for "Public Purpose" infrastructure rely on the procedural timelines defined in Section 4 and 5 of this Act.
