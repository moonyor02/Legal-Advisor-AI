Related Case/Conflict: Kokrajhar Industrial Allotment (June–December 2025)
Case Title: Conflict over 3,400 Bighas of Land Allotment for Adani Thermal Power Project (Bashbari, Kokrajhar).

Facts of the Case: In mid-2025, the BTC administration authorized the allotment of approximately 3,400 bighas (approx. 992 acres) of land in the Bashbari-Paglijhora area (Kokrajhar) for a proposed 3,200 MW thermal power plant by the Adani Group in partnership with the Assam Power Distribution Corporation Limited (APDCL). This sparked massive protests from the All Assam Tribal Students Union (AATSU) and local residents.

Legal Issues: 1. Lack of Gram Sabha Consent: Petitioners argue the allotment violated the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006, as no community consultation was conducted for land occupied by indigenous forest dwellers. 2. Environmental Sensitivity: The land reportedly includes parts of the Paglijhora area, which is considered ecologically sensitive. 3. Sixth Schedule Violation: Protesters contend that "handing over" vast tracts of tribal land to private corporations undermines the core intent of the Sixth Schedule.

Current Status (December 2025): While the BTC leadership has promised that no indigenous land will be forcibly taken and that thousands of jobs will be created, the Gauhati High Court has taken a cautious stance. In a similar case in the neighboring Dima Hasao district (Sonesh Hojai v. State of Assam, August 2025), the Court expressed "shock" at the allotment of 3,000 bighas to a private firm, calling it "extraordinary" and ordering a full policy review. This has set a strong legal precedent that may halt or delay the Kokrajhar project until the BTC can prove a "Rational Policy" for such large allotments.
