[JUDICIAL DATA: LANDMARK ENFORCEMENT — KOKRAJHAR/BTC]

Case Name: Prodyut Kumar Bora v. The State of Assam and 8 Ors (PIL 78/2012) Court: Gauhati High Court (Division Bench) Key Order Dates: Dec 9, 2019 (Original Mandate) / Jan–Dec 2025 (Compliance Enforcement)

1. Facts & Ruling: The Court addressed massive encroachments in tribal belts. It directed the Deputy Commissioners of Kokrajhar, Baksa, Chirang, and Udalguri to strictly implement Chapter X and evict all "ineligible occupants."

2. 2025 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

Affidavit Deadline (Jan 5, 2025): The Court recently directed the Karbi Anglong and BTR councils to file final status affidavits after a 2-year delay.

Early Ruling Request: Following unrest in December 2025 regarding grazing lands (VGR/PGR), the State Government moved the High Court to vacate stay orders on specific evictions to allow the clearing of over 8,000 bighas.

Officer Accountability: The High Court re-emphasized that costs will be deducted from the salaries of DCs/Revenue Officers who fail to clear encroachments identified in the 2019 order.

3. KEY PROTECTIONS FOR USERS:

The Court clarified that while evictions are mandatory, they must follow due process.

VGR/PGR Lands: In the 2025 tripartite meetings, it was decided that government offices on grazing lands would be shifted out first before removing local houses.

4. AI TOOL LOGIC: If a user is facing eviction in Kokrajhar, the AI must check if they are "Protected Class." If they are not, the AI must advise that the Prodyut Bora order makes eviction inevitable, but they are still entitled to a formal notice under Section 165 of the 1886 Regulation.
