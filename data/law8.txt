Title: The Assam Forest Regulation, 1891 (Statutory Framework)

[KLLA DATASET: STATUTORY LAW — FOREST PROTECTION]

1. RESERVED FORESTS (Chapter II):

Section 4 (Constitutional Power): The State can declare any land "at the disposal of the Government" as a Reserved Forest. In Kokrajhar/BTC, this includes areas like Ultapani and Ripu-Chirang.

Section 17 (Finality): Once a final notification is issued under Section 17, all previous rights over that land are extinguished unless specifically recorded by the Forest Settlement Officer.

2. PROHIBITED ACTS (Section 24 & 25):

Trespass: Any person who enters, fells trees, or clears land for cultivation in a Reserved Forest is liable for prosecution.

Strict Liability: Claiming "ignorance" of the forest boundary is not a valid legal defense if the forest was properly notified.

3. NEW 2025 CRIMINAL AMENDMENT (Judicial Interpretation):

Section 25(f) Expansion: As per the Gauhati High Court mandate (August 2025), forest encroachment is no longer just a civil trespass; it is to be treated as a criminal offense with mandatory registration of FIRs against encroachers and facilitating officials.

4. FOREST SETTLEMENT (Section 5-15):

Before a forest becomes "Reserved," a Forest Settlement Officer (FSO) must settle all public claims. Once this period passes, no new rights (pattas) can be created within the forest.
