CONTEXT: LAND GRABBING AND FRAUDULENT TRANSFER

1. LAND GRABBING ACT, 2010 (ASSAM):
Occupying land without legal documents is a criminal offense. A 'Special Land Tribunal' can be approached for fast-track justice against land-grabbing organizations.

2. FAKE POWER OF ATTORNEY:
If an organization claims to have bought your land via 'Power of Attorney' without your knowledge, file a 'Deed Cancellation' suit in the Civil Court immediately.

3. BTC NOC REQUIREMENT:
In Kokrajhar, any land transfer to an organization requires a 'No Objection Certificate' (NOC) from the BTC. Transfers without this NOC are not legally valid.
