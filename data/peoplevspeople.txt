DOCUMENT TYPE: LEGAL PROCEDURE - FAMILY PARTITION
CONTEXT: PEOPLE VS. PEOPLE (INTERNAL FAMILY DISPUTE)

1. JOINT PATTA VS. SEPARATE PATTA:
In Kokrajhar, land is often held under a 'Joint Patta' (multiple names on one deed). No single member can legally sell a specific portion until a 'Perfect Partition' is executed.

2. PROCEDURE FOR PARTITION (SECTION 97, ALRR 1886):
- Step 1: All legal heirs must file a 'Partition Suit' at the Revenue Circle Office.
- Step 2: The Circle Officer (CO) will issue a public notice to check for objections.
- Step 3: A Government Mandal will survey the land and allot a unique 'Dag Number' (Plot Number) to each heir.

3. LEGAL DEFENSE:
If one co-sharer sells family land without the written consent of others, the sale can be challenged as 'Voidable' under the Assam Land & Revenue Regulation.
