Case Update: Ultapani & Rengma Forest Evictions (2024–2025)
Case Reference: Abdul Khalek vs. State of Assam (Gauhati HC, August 2025) and Kokrajhar Ultapani Operations (November 2024).

Facts of the Conflict:

Ultapani (Nov 2024): Forest range officers and Kokrajhar police detained 131 individuals for "illegal deforestation" in the Sikhnajhar area of the Ultapani range. Over 500 people were reportedly involved in mass clearing.

Rengma/Uriamghat (June 2025): One of the largest eviction drives in recent history reclaimed 15,000 bighas in the Rengma Reserve Forest. Over 2,000 structures were demolished using bulldozers.

Judicial Landmark (August 2025): The Gauhati High Court (Abdul Khalek case) ruled that while "no person can claim protection if found encroaching upon forest land," the state must follow due process:

First Notice: A 15-day notice to explain the circumstances of their residence.

Second Notice: If the state rejects the explanation, an additional 15-day notice must be given to leave the forest voluntarily before forced eviction begins.
