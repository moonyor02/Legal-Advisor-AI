Title: BTC Land and Revenue Regulation (Application, Adoption and Modification) Bill, 2025

Description: The BTC Land and Revenue Regulation (Application, Adoption and Modification) Bill, 2025 is a landmark piece of regional legislation passed by the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) on July 31, 2025. It represents a significant exercise of the Council’s legislative powers under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The Bill overhauls land administration across the four districts of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR): Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa, and Udalguri. Its primary goal is to replace archaic colonial-era rules with a modern, digital-first system that prioritizes indigenous land security while facilitating structured industrial growth.

Extracted Bill Highlights — BTC Land & Revenue Regulation, 2025
✔ Legislative Intent: To establish a "citizen-centric" land governance model that streamlines land acquisition, ensures fair compensation for public projects, and prevents the illegal alienation of tribal land.

✔ Core Provisions: 1. Administrative Autonomy: Grants the BTC independent authority to handle land settlements, mutations, and revenue disputes, reducing dependency on the state-level Board of Revenue. 2. Digital Land Records (Mission Bwiswmuthi 2.0): Mandates the transition to an online, paperless registration system to eliminate fraudulent land claims and provide transparent ownership chains. 3. Indigenous Safeguards: Strictly enforces the protection of tribal land rights, ensuring that land in protected belts is not transferred to non-protected classes without rigorous constitutional compliance.

Key Legal Effect
✔ Regulatory Certainty: Provides the BTC with a clear legal mandate to regulate land use for both agriculture and industry. ✔ Dispute Reduction: Digitization is legally expected to lower the volume of land-related litigation in the BTR. ✔ Judicial Accountability: While granting the BTC more power, all orders issued under this Bill remain subject to the Writ Jurisdiction of the Gauhati High Court under Article 226.
