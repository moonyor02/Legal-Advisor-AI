Title: Chapter X — Protection of Tribal Belts and Blocks (Assam Regulation 1886)

[KLLA DATASET: STATUTORY LAW — TRIBAL PROTECTIONS]

1. PROTECTED AREAS & CLASSES (Sections 160-161):

Objective: To protect specific groups from land alienation.

Protected Classes: Tribes (Plains/Hills), Scheduled Castes, Santhals, Tea-tribes, Koch-Rajbongshis, and as of 2021, Gorkhas (as bonafide Indian citizens).

Geographic Scope: Includes notified belts in Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa, and Udalguri (BTR region).

2. TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS (Section 162):

Rule: Land within these belts cannot be transferred (sold, leased, or mortgaged) to any person who is not a member of a "Protected Class" without prior government permission.

Violation: Any such transfer is void ab initio (legally invalid from the start).

3. EVICTION POWERS (Section 165):

Summary Ejectment: Revenue authorities (DCs) have the power to summarily evict any ineligible person occupying land in these belts.

Due Process: While "summary," the law mandates a one-month notice for settled landholders and a reasonable hearing before physical removal.

4. EXCLUSIONS (Section 162-A):

Rights acquired by non-protected persons prior to the notification of the belt (e.g., historical settlers) are generally protected, but subject to strict verification.
