Title: The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA)

Description: The FRA is a central legislation that recognizes the pre-existing rights of forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFDs). It rectifies "historical injustice" by providing legal titles to land occupied prior to December 13, 2005. In the BTR context, it serves as a critical shield against land diversion for industrial projects without local consent.
